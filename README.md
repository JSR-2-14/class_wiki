  <li><details><summary><strong>Week 4</strong></summary><p>
  
   <p>
  In Week 4, we learned all about <b>React</b> and what an amazing language it can be for developers.  We learned the concepts of <b>components</b>, <b>props</b>, and about <b>React Hooks</b> and <b>functional components</b>.  We learned hooks like <b>useState</b>, <b>useEffect</b>, and <b>useReducer</b> and where to best put them to use in our apps.  We learned about the idea of <b>conditional rendering</b> and how we can use our user's input to influence our output.  We were also introduced to <b>React Router</b> and got to see how it gives us powerful new tools to build our React Apps.
