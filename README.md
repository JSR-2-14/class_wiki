<ul type="none">

<details><summary><strong>Week 7</strong></summary>

<p>
  In Week 7, we learn how we can use JavaScript with external libraries like <b>React</b> to make our web pages even more dynamic. We learn how <b>components</b> in React can make our code more modular and reusable. Then we learn how the relationships between our components matter by building out <b>Component Hierarchy Diagrams</b>. We learn to pass <b>props</b> between our components and get to practice this concept with a fun Lord of the Rings lab.
