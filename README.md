  <p>Hello everyone, I am a default placeholder for an instructors introduction paragraph. This instructor's role will be to be a faceless representation of what an instructor might be, but nothing more. They will lead no lessons, they will offer no help, they will father no sons. They are void.</p>
  <p>I am nothing but a filler for where an instructor might put their personal brand statement! I just sit here and fill space so that the developer can see what it might look like when an instructor has actually provided them with their intro. I have no purpose beyond that and my existence is meaningless!</p>

  <p>
  In Week 5, we move into more complicated React Hooks like <b>useEffect</b> and <b>useReducer</b>.  We learn about the idea of <b>conditional rendering</b> and how we can use our user's input to influence our output.  We are also introduced to <b>React Router</b> and get to see how it gives us powerful new tools to build our React Apps. Then we are introduced to back-end and get to practice using <b>Express</b> and <b>Express Middleware</b>.  We also learn how to implement <b>controllers</b>.  We then get a taste of <b>MongoDB</b> and <b>mongoose</b> as a way to store our app's data.
